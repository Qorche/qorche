# Development Guide

This guide covers everything you need to contribute to Qorche. For machine-readable project conventions used by Claude Code, see `CLAUDE.md`.

## Building and running

Qorche is a multi-module Kotlin project built with Gradle. JDK 21+ is required.

```bash
./gradlew test                        # Run all tests (64MB heap, excludes benchmarks)
./gradlew :agent:benchmark            # Run benchmark suite (100–20k files)
./gradlew :agent:largeBenchmark       # Run large-scale benchmarks (50k–100k files, 512MB heap)
./gradlew :cli:run --args="plan tasks.yaml"    # Dry-run a task graph
./gradlew :cli:run --args="run tasks.yaml"     # Execute a task graph
./gradlew :cli:nativeCompile          # Build native CLI binary (requires GraalVM)
./gradlew :native:nativeCompile       # Build shared library (libqorche)
```

The CLI always runs from the project root directory (`workingDir = rootProject.projectDir` is set in `cli/build.gradle.kts`). This matters because the orchestrator takes snapshots relative to the working directory.

## Project structure

```
qorche/
├── core/       # Orchestrator, snapshots, MVCC, DAG, WAL with zero domain-specific deps
├── agent/      # AgentRunner implementations (MockAgentRunner, ShellRunner, ClaudeCodeAdapter)
├── cli/        # CLI entry point via Clikt (run, plan, init, validate, status, logs, diff, clean)
├── native/     # Shared library (libqorche) via GraalVM --shared, C FFI entry points
└── docs/       # Architecture docs and planning
```

## Module boundaries

These are strict and enforced by Gradle's dependency graph:

- **core/** depends on nothing except Kotlin stdlib, kotlinx.coroutines, kotlinx.serialization, kotlinx.datetime, and kaml (YAML). It has zero references to AI, LLMs, agents, or any specific domain. If you need an external system, define an interface in core/ and implement it elsewhere.
- **agent/** depends on core/ only. Contains concrete `AgentRunner` implementations. Each adapter is self-contained with no adapter depending on another.
- **cli/** depends on core/ and agent/. This is the composition root and the only module that produces user-facing terminal output.
- **native/** depends on core/ only. Provides C FFI entry points for the shared library.

Never import from agent/ or cli/ in core/. If you're tempted to, define an interface in core/ instead.

## Design principles

### Agents are untrusted reporters of their own side effects

This is the most important design axiom. Never rely on an agent's self-reported file modifications for correctness. LLM agents may not report all writes (Claude Code in `--print` mode emits no FileModified events), may report writes that didn't happen, or may crash after partial writes.

The MVCC system independently verifies filesystem state through before/after SHA-256 snapshots. Agent reports are hints for performance optimisation only, snapshots are ground truth.

This principle drives several concrete decisions:
- `FileIndex` is fully cleared before after-snapshots (not selectively invalidated based on agent reports)
- Scope audit operates at the group level (can't attribute undeclared writes to a specific task)
- After-snapshots are always taken, even when the agent throws an exception
- Conflict detection compares snapshot hashes, not agent-reported file lists

### Snapshot-first, not event-first

Correctness comes from filesystem snapshots, not from tracking individual file operations. This makes Qorche work with any worker type regardless of whether it reports what it does, and catches unexpected side effects that event-based approaches would miss.

### Crash-safe

If a worker crashes mid-execution, the after-snapshot still captures the dirty filesystem state. Partial writes are visible to conflict detection. The WAL logs the failure so the audit trail is complete.

## Key components

### Snapshot system (`core/Snapshot.kt`, `core/FileIndex.kt`)
- `SnapshotCreator.create()` walks a directory tree, hashes every file, and produces an immutable `Snapshot`
- `FileIndex` is an mtime-based cache that avoids re-hashing unchanged files (same optimisation as `git status`)
- Line endings are normalised to `\n` before hashing for cross-platform consistency
- All paths stored with forward slashes as canonical form
- Hash algorithm is configurable: SHA-1 (default, same as git), CRC32C (fastest, hardware-accelerated), SHA-256 (cryptographic)

### Task graph (`core/TaskGraph.kt`)
- Hand-rolled DAG with adjacency list with no graph library needed
- Topological sort via DFS for execution order
- Cycle detection via three-color DFS marking
- `parallelGroups()` identifies tasks that can run concurrently

### Conflict detection (`core/ConflictDetector.kt`)
- `detectGroupConflicts()`: O(n²) pairwise comparison of changed file sets across a parallel group
- `resolveConflicts()`: deterministic winner selection based on YAML definition order
- `detectScopeViolations()`: group-level audit comparing actual filesystem changes against declared scopes

### Orchestrator (`core/Orchestrator.kt`)
- `runGraphParallel()`: executes task DAG with concurrent groups, MVCC conflict detection, retry, and scope audit
- `snapshotAndRun()`: core lifecycle: before-snapshot → run agent → clear cache → after-snapshot → WAL log
- Loser rollback deletes the loser's non-conflicting files before retry so the retried task starts from clean state

### WAL (`core/WAL.kt`)
- Append-only JSON Lines file at `.qorche/wal.jsonl`
- Sealed class hierarchy: TaskStarted, TaskCompleted, TaskFailed, ConflictDetected, TaskRetryScheduled, TaskRetried, ScopeViolation
- Every state-changing action is logged before the change is applied
- Concurrent WAL writes (from parallel tasks) are serialized via `kotlinx.coroutines.sync.Mutex`

### Shared library (`native/`)
- `LibQorcheEntryPoints.java`: thin Java layer handling GraalVM `@CEntryPoint` constraints
- `QorcheApi.kt`: pure Kotlin API accepting and returning JSON strings
- Functions: `qorche_version`, `qorche_validate_yaml`, `qorche_plan`, `qorche_snapshot`, `qorche_diff`, `qorche_free`
- Memory contract: every function returning `CCharPointer` allocates via `UnmanagedMemory`; caller must free via `qorche_free()`
- Python test harness in `native/examples/test_libqorche.py`

## GraalVM native-image compatibility

This is critical. The CLI and shared library are compiled to native binaries via GraalVM native-image. These constraints must be followed for all code:

- **No runtime reflection** ever. No `Class.forName()`, no `field.setAccessible()`.
- **No dynamic class loading** or runtime proxy generation.
- **No Gson or Jackson** use `kotlinx.serialization` exclusively.
- **No `java.io.Serializable`** for data transfer.
- Use `@Serializable` on all persistent data classes.
- If adding a new dependency, verify GraalVM compatibility first.
- Native-image configuration lives in `src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/`.

## Cross-platform rules

Qorche runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. CI tests on both Ubuntu and Windows.

- Always use `java.nio.file.Path` for file operations, never string concatenation
- Store all paths with forward slashes: `path.replace("\\", "/")`
- Normalise line endings to `\n` before hashing
- Process spawning: use binary name without extension (e.g., `claude` not `claude.exe`). The OS resolves extensions automatically.

## Coding conventions

- Data classes for all value types
- Sealed classes for algebraic types (`AgentEvent`, `TaskStatus`, `WALEntry`)
- Kotlin coroutines for all async work, no raw threads, no `CompletableFuture`
- `val` over `var`, immutable collections over mutable
- No wildcard imports
- `Result<T>` or sealed class results for expected failures; exceptions only for programmer errors
- Agent failures are expected, model them in the type system
- Always clean up child processes on error (shutdown hooks, `try`/`finally`)

## Serialization

- `kotlinx.serialization` with `@Serializable` on all persistent data classes
- JSON as primary format (`kotlinx-serialization-json`)
- YAML for task definitions (`kaml` library)
- WAL uses JSON Lines format (`.jsonl`), one JSON object per line, append-only
- Timestamps: `kotlinx.datetime.Instant`
- Paths: stored as `String` (forward-slash canonical), not `java.nio.file.Path`

## Memory discipline

- Target: < 30MB RSS idle with `-Xmx64m`
- Stream file contents through `MessageDigest`, never read entire files into memory
- Use `Sequence`/`Flow` instead of intermediate `List` copies for large collections
- Minimise object allocations in hot paths (file hashing, snapshot comparison)
- Tests run with `-Xmx64m`; benchmarks with `-Xmx128m`; large-scale with `-Xmx512m`

## Testing

- Core logic tested against `MockAgentRunner`, no LLM calls needed
- `kotlinx-coroutines-test` for async testing
- Integration tests with real processes (`RealProcessRunner`) are included in the standard test suite, these caught a real `ConcurrentHashMap` corruption bug that mock tests missed
- Cross-platform path handling tested explicitly
- Benchmark tests are tagged and excluded from the default `./gradlew test` task
- Test fixtures live in `cli/src/test/resources/fixtures/`

## Local data directory

Qorche stores all local state in `.qorche/` (similar to `.git/`):

```
.qorche/
├── snapshots/        # Snapshot JSON files ({uuid}.json)
├── logs/             # Per-task agent output logs ({taskId}.log)
├── wal.jsonl         # Write-ahead log (JSON Lines, append-only)
└── file-index.json   # Mtime/hash cache for fast re-snapshots
```

This directory should be in `.gitignore` for user projects. The `qorche init` command handles this automatically.

## Per-task runner assignment

Tasks can specify which runner executes them via the `runner` field in YAML, referencing a named entry in the top-level `runners` map. This enables mixing different tools (LLM agents, shell commands) in the same DAG.

### How it works

- **core/Task.kt**: `RunnerConfig` defines runner configuration (type, model, endpoint, extra_args, allowed_commands, timeout_seconds). `TaskDefinition` has an optional `runner: String?` field. `TaskProject` has a `runners: Map<String, RunnerConfig>` map.
- **core/TaskYamlParser.kt**: Validates that every task's `runner` reference points to a defined entry in the `runners` map at parse time.
- **core/Orchestrator.kt**: `runGraph()` and `runGraphParallel()` accept a `runners: Map<String, AgentRunner>` registry alongside the default `runner`. Each task is dispatched to its named runner, or the default if unset.
- **agent/RunnerRegistry.kt**: Builds `Map<String, AgentRunner>` from `Map<String, RunnerConfig>`. Maps `type` to concrete implementations (`claude-code` → `ClaudeCodeAdapter`, `shell` → `ShellRunner`).
- **cli/Commands.kt**: Builds the runner registry from `TaskProject.runners` and passes it to the orchestrator.

### Backward compatibility

Existing YAML files without `runners` or per-task `runner` fields work unchanged. The `runners` map defaults to empty and unset `runner` fields fall back to the default CLI runner.

## Adding a new adapter

1. Create a new file in `agent/src/main/kotlin/io/qorche/agent/` (e.g., `OllamaAdapter.kt`)
2. Implement the `AgentRunner` interface from `core/`
3. Your adapter receives an instruction string, a working directory, and an output callback
4. Return a `Flow<AgentEvent>` with lifecycle events (Output, FileModified, Completed, Error)
5. Register the new type in `RunnerRegistry.createRunner()` so YAML `type: your-type` maps to the new adapter
6. The orchestrator handles everything else, snapshots, conflict detection, retry, WAL logging
7. Add tests using the same patterns as `ShellRunnerTest` or `ClaudeCodeAdapterTest`
8. Do not depend on other adapters, each adapter is self-contained

## Runner Configuration

Runner configuration uses a layered model inspired by Terraform and Docker Compose. Higher layers override lower layers with field-level merge semantics.

### Config layers

| Layer | Location | Purpose | Checked in? |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Project defaults** | `.qorche/runners.yaml` | Project-level runner infra (endpoints, timeouts, secrets) | No (gitignored) |
| **Task inline** | `tasks.yaml` `runners:` block | The contract: what runners a task file needs | Yes |
| **Environment** | `QORCHE_RUNNER_{NAME}_{FIELD}` env vars | CI/CD injection, secrets, overrides | N/A |

Higher layer wins. `tasks.yaml` defines the **shape** (what runners exist); `.qorche/runners.yaml` and env vars fill in the **details**. Missing required fields after merge produce a clear error at validation time.

### `runners.example.yaml`

`qorche init` generates `.qorche/runners.example.yaml` (like `.env.example`). This file is checked in and documents the runners the project expects, without containing actual secrets.

### `qorche config` command

```bash
# Show merged config with all layers resolved
qorche config tasks.yaml

# Check for missing/incomplete runner configuration
qorche config tasks.yaml --check

# Output env var template for CI setup
qorche config tasks.yaml --env-template
```

`--check` tells you exactly what's missing and how to fix it. `--env-template` outputs a ready-to-paste block of environment variable assignments for CI pipelines.

### `env:` field

`RunnerConfig` supports an `env` field — a map of environment variables passed to the runner process. Values support `${VAR}` substitution from the host environment:

```yaml
runners:
  claude:
    type: claude-code
    env:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
  deploy:
    type: shell
    env:
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
```

Substitution is minimal: `${VAR}` only, no defaults, no nesting, no expressions. An unset variable produces a clear error.

### Environment variable convention

Runner fields can be overridden entirely via environment variables following this pattern:

```
QORCHE_RUNNER_{RUNNER_NAME}_{FIELD}=value
```

For example:
```bash
QORCHE_RUNNER_CLAUDE_TYPE=claude-code
QORCHE_RUNNER_CLAUDE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300
QORCHE_RUNNER_SHELL_ALLOWED_COMMANDS=npm,gradle,pytest
```

### CI example (GitHub Actions)

```yaml
- name: Run Qorche
  env:
    QORCHE_RUNNER_CLAUDE_TYPE: claude-code
    QORCHE_RUNNER_CLAUDE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS: 300
    QORCHE_RUNNER_CLAUDE_EXTRA_ARGS: --dangerously-skip-permissions
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
  run: qorche run tasks.yaml
```

This lets the same `tasks.yaml` work locally (with `.qorche/runners.yaml` providing secrets) and in CI (with env vars injected by the pipeline).

## CI/CD

- GitHub Actions runs tests on every push to `main`/`develop` and on PRs
- Matrix: `ubuntu-latest` + `windows-latest`
- Releases triggered by semantic-release on merge to `main`
- Native binaries built for Linux (amd64), Windows (amd64), and macOS (arm64) on tagged releases
- Linux binaries compressed with UPX for smaller download size

## Versioning

Qorche uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for automated versioning, configured in `.releaserc.json`.

### Branch strategy

- **`main`** — the only release branch. Merges to `main` trigger semantic-release which computes the next version from commit messages, creates a Git tag, and publishes a GitHub release with native binaries.
- **`develop`** — integration branch. Feature branches merge here via PR. Does NOT trigger releases.
- **Feature branches** — branch from `develop`, PR back to `develop`.

### Version scheme

We follow semver and are currently in `0.x` (pre-stable). The version will stay at `0.x.y` until an explicit decision to go `1.0`.

| Commit prefix | Version bump | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| `feat:` | Minor (0.1.0 → 0.2.0) | New command, new API |
| `fix:` | Patch (0.1.0 → 0.1.1) | Bug fix |
| `perf:` | Patch | Performance improvement |
| `revert:` | Patch | Reverted commit |
| `BREAKING CHANGE` in footer | Major (0.x → 1.0.0) | API removal, format change |

Other commit types (`refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `ci:`) do **not** trigger releases.

### Dev builds (bleeding edge)

Pushes to `develop` trigger the **Dev Artifacts** workflow (`.github/workflows/dev-artifacts.yml`), which:

1. Runs `scripts/version_calc.py --stamp` to compute a dev version like `v0.2.0-dev.5`
2. Builds native binaries (Linux + Windows)
3. Publishes them to a rolling **dev-latest** GitHub pre-release

The dev version stamp is calculated by:
- Reading the latest stable tag from `main` (e.g., `v0.1.0`)
- Parsing all commits since that tag using conventional commit format
- Computing the expected next version (e.g., `v0.2.0` if there are `feat:` commits)
- Appending `-dev.{commit-count}` (e.g., `v0.2.0-dev.5` = 5 commits toward 0.2.0)

This gives users a clear picture: "this build is 5 commits toward what will become 0.2.0 on main."

### PR preflight checks

The **PR Preflight** workflow (`.github/workflows/pr-preflight.yml`) runs on PRs to `main` and `develop`:

- Calculates the expected version impact of the PR
- Comments on the PR with the version summary
- Warns if a breaking change would trigger a major bump (e.g., `v0.x` → `v1.0.0`)
- Warns if no releasable commits are present (merge won't trigger a release)

### Version calculation script

`scripts/version_calc.py` is the single source of truth for version calculation outside of semantic-release. It has 48 unit tests in `scripts/test_version_calc.py` covering all edge cases. Run them with:

```bash
cd scripts && python -m unittest test_version_calc -v
```

Modes:
- `--stamp`: print dev version stamp (e.g., `v0.2.0-dev.5`)
- `--preflight`: PR check with warnings for unexpected bumps
- `--dry-run`: show what the next release version would be
- `--current`: show the current version from the latest tag

### Important rules

- Do **not** add `develop` as a release branch in `.releaserc.json` — this previously caused an erroneous `v1.0.0-beta.1` prerelease because semantic-release treated `feat:` commits on develop as triggering a version bump independently from main
- Do **not** use `BREAKING CHANGE` in commit footers unless you genuinely intend a major version bump
- The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) only runs on pushes to `main`
- Tags follow the format `v${version}` (e.g., `v0.2.0`)
- When merging `develop` → `main`, use a **regular merge** (not squash) so semantic-release sees all individual commit messages
- When merging feature → `develop`, squash is fine since the dev stamping script handles granularity
